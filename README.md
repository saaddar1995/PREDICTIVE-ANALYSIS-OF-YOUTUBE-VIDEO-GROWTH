PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS OF YOUTUBE VIDEO GROWTH WITH TIME SERIES TECHNIQUES ARIMA, SARIMAX, XGBOOST

YouTube is best video-sharing platform used on the internet, which is used to share videos, give comments on the video, save videos, and upload content. Videos that get high views and likes by the time they get popular. Creators of the YouTube platform have a significant interest in predicting the growth of their videos over a period of time.  Although YouTube's video growth prediction has not been well studied yet. In this study, we explore the different time series forecasting algorithms, those are ARIMA, SARIMAX, and XGBOOST, used for predicting the growth of YouTube videos. By retrieving specific YouTube video data using YouTube DATA API. The dataset contains historical views with specific date statistics and for this, our goal is to find patterns and trends that can be used for predictions of future video growth. Our Research also focuses on each algorithm's accuracy. This study shows a comparative analysis of these algorithms to find the most suitable approach for video growth prediction. Additionally, this study follows the structure of the CRISP-DM methodology. This study also helps content creators at YouTube to make better decisions and ideas about their content.
